// NOTE:
// This module type is not even necessary.  The core framework has no dependency on it and doesn't
// make use of it at all.
// These are only used by script sequences, which are now externally defined.
// So why keep it in here?
// Solely as a favor to script sequences; to provide the benefit of the module framework
// we have as a nice and easy way to define and get access to different languages.  And
// to provide a unified interface for such things.
